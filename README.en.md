# 📊 Data Visualization - Analysis of the Leading Causes of Death Worldwide

## 📌 Description
This dashboard was designed to visualize the **main causes of death worldwide**, considering only those that represent **0.5% or more of total global deaths**.

Causes with lower incidence were grouped under a category named **“Others”**, allowing for a cleaner and more comparative representation.  
The main goal was to create a **clear, readable, and minimalist visualization** that enables quick interpretation of the data.

## 📂 Dataset
**Main variables:**
- **Cause of death or injury** → Cause of death or injury.  
- **Percent of total deaths** → Percentage of total deaths (range 0–1).  
- **Deaths annual % change** → Annual percentage change in deaths (range -1 to 1).

## 🔍 Analysis and Design Process

### 1. Filtering of Relevant Causes
- Included only causes of death contributing **≥ 0.5% of total global deaths**.  
- All other causes were grouped under an **“Others”** category using a conditional measure (`IF` + `GROUP BY`).

### 2. Main Visualization
- **Scatter plot** representing:  
  - **X-axis:** Annual change in deaths (`Deaths annual % change`).  
  - **Y-axis:** Percentage of total deaths (`Percent of total deaths`).  
  - **Labels:** Cause of death.

### 3. Visual Comparison
- Allows for quick identification of which causes account for higher proportions and whether they show an **upward or downward trend**.  
- Neutral colors were used to maintain visual cleanliness and highlight **positive or negative variations**.

### 4. Interactivity and Accuracy
- Added **tooltips** to display exact percentage and annual variation values.  
- Axis scales were adjusted to match the actual data range, avoiding visual distortion.

## 📈 Results and Insights
The **main global causes of death** identified were:
- **Ischemic heart disease**  
- **Stroke**  
- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease**

Identified **positive and negative annual variation patterns**:
- Causes such as **respiratory infections** and **diarrheal diseases** showed a decline.  
- Some **non-communicable diseases** (e.g., cancer or Alzheimer’s) continued to show slight growth.  
- The **“Others”** category groups causes with very low incidence (< 0.5%).
